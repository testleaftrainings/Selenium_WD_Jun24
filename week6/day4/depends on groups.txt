Steps to execute as a groups in TestNG
--------------------------------------
    1. Use attribute as alwaysRun = true for all the annotations(@BeforeSuite, @BeforeTest, @BeforeClass, @BeforeMethod, @AfterMethod, @AfterSuite)
    2. Use a attribute groups in test. By using groups attribute we can able to assign assign multiple group name for the testcase/AfterMethod. (Eg: groups{"smoke", "regression", "functional"} )
    3. Create a xml file for Testcases , add a groups tag to incldue and exclude the group name, Below are the sample groups tag for xml.
    <groups>
        <run>
            <include name="squad1"></include>
            <include name="squad2"></include>
            <include name="squad4"></include>
            <exclude name="squad3"></exclude>
        </run>
    </groups>

    4. It will execute the testcase which is having the groups as either "squad1" or "squad2" or "squad4" and also it will not execute groups name which is having as "squad3".
    5. Note : groups will work only for the testcases mentioned in the xml file.
